			<h5>Everyone feels stressed from time to time. Stress can give you a rush of energy when it’s needed most.

Learning healthy ways to cope with stress can also boost your resilience.</h5>

			<h5>To fit in everything we want to do in our day, we often sacrifice sleep. But sleep affects both mental and physical health. It’s vital to your well-being. When you’re tired, you can’t function at your best. Sleep helps you think more clearly, have quicker reflexes and focus better. Take steps to make sure you regularly get a good night’s sleep.</h5>

It means not living your life on “autopilot.” Becoming a more mindful person requires commitment and practice. Here are some tips to help you get started.</h5>
